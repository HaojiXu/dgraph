# EKS with eksctl

This demonstrates how to provision a Kubernetes cluster using [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/).

Here are two ways to use `eksctl` command line tool:

* create VPC infrastructure and EKS
* create EKS on an existing VPC infrastructure

There are some terraform modules that can create the VPC infrastructure as well as a configuration file that can be used with `eksctl`.  These may be useful reference to show the requirements needed to provision EKS on an existing VPC.
